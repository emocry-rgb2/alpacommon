#
# This sample yaml configuration file contains two stages and three jobs.
# This configuration uses GitLab's `only`, `when`, and `except` configuration
# options to create a pipeline that will create the `pulumi-preview` job in the pipeline,
# for all branches except the master.
# Only for master branch merges, the main `pulumi` job is executed automatically.
stages:
  - build
  - infrastructure-update

# Each stage may require multiple jobs to complete that stage.
# Consider a build stage, which may require building the UI, service, and a CLI.
# All 3 individual build jobs can be attributed to the build _stage_.
